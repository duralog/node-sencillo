# Gitteh

Native libgit2 bindings for Node.js, complete with a stupid name.

Under active development. Nasty code written by an idiot with the equivalent of a preschooler grade understanding of C++. Nothing to see here. Move along.

# Plans

* Learn C++
* Possibly make the API more object-graph like. Currently requesting the same commit from repo will give two different objects. Should it be like this?
* Bind everything libgit2 has to offer and make it available to Node.js.
* Evaluate if async is necessary, implement where needed if it is.
* Possibly provide a higher level API over the bindings (perhaps in a separate project).
* Async support
